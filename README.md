# Overview
This repository provides efficient and practical implementations of essential data structures and algorithms in Python. It covers topics such as trees, lists, search techniques,  Linear and Binary Search Algorithms, sorting algorithms, Recursive and interactive sequences and general algorithm design.

# Implementation
The repository includes implementations of various foundational data structures and algorithms:

Trees: Hierarchical structures consisting of nodes, where each node holds a value and references to its child nodes.
Lists: Ordered collections of elements that can contain different types.
Searching Algorithms: Techniques for efficiently retrieving data from a data structure.
Sorting Algorithms: Methods for organizing data in a specific order, typically ascending or descending.
Performance Analysis: Understanding the efficiency of data structures and algorithms to choose the best fit based on problem requirements.
Recursive and interactive sequences: Implement this to generate Fibonacci sequences in Python. Which help us understand the differences between recursive and iterative problem-solving techniques, 
 Linear and Binary Search Algorithms: Will learn the differences between search methods, their time complexities, and when to use each one. This helps practice algorithm implementation, list manipulation, and control structures
