This practical provides a set of Python functions designed to analyse text files. It performs various text analysis tasks such as counting lines, words, unique words, and specific word occurrences, as well as calculating average word length and identifying the most common and longest words in the text.

# Reading Files:
  It includes a function to read the contents of a specified text file. This function opens the file, reads the content, and returns it for analysis.
# Counting Lines: 
  This function counts the number of lines in the text, allowing users to measure the length of the document.
# Counting Words: 
  The count_words function counts the total number of words in the text, providing insight into the document's size.
# Average Word Length: 
  The average_word_length function calculates the average length of the words in the text, helping to assess the complexity of the language used.
# Most Common Word:
  It identifies the most frequently occurring word in the text, along with its count, which can be useful for understanding the main topics or themes.
# Counting Unique Words: 
  It counts the number of unique words in the text, giving an idea of the vocabulary diversity used.
# Finding the Longest Word: 
 The function determines the longest word in the text, which can be interesting for language analysis.
# Counting Occurrences of a Specific Word:
 This function allows users to count how many times a specific word appears in the text, with 'the' used as an example.
# Percentage of Words Longer than Average Length:
 It calculates the percentage of words that are longer than the average word length, providing insights into the text’s readability.

# How to Use It:
The practical is straightforward to use. Simply place your text file (e.g., sample.txt) in the practical directory and call the analyze_text function with the filename as an argument. The program will read the file and print various statistics about the text.

This Practical work contains various implementations and utilities for generating Fibonacci numbers, including recursive, iterative, and memoized approaches. It also includes functions to analyse the Fibonacci sequence, such as checking if a number is a Fibonacci number, finding the first Fibonacci number exceeding a given value, and calculating the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

# Recursive Fibonacci Generator:
 Computes Fibonacci numbers using a recursive algorithm.
# Iterative Fibonacci Generator:
 Efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach.
# Memoized Fibonacci Generator:
 Enhances the recursive algorithm with memoization to improve performance.
# Fibonacci Sequence Generator:
 Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.
# Check Fibonacci Number:
 Determines if a given number is a Fibonacci number using mathematical properties.
# Index Finder:
 Finds the index of the first Fibonacci number that exceeds a specified value.
# Fibonacci Ratios:
 Calculates the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers to observe convergence towards the golden ratio.
